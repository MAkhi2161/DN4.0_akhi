Hi, I'm Akhila, and this repository was created to post and maintain the weekly exercises given in the Deepskilling Manual by Cognizant. Each folder contains either Java or Python code implementations and output screenshots as part of my learning journey. The exercises are organized week-wise for clarity and easy tracking.Each exercise contains the codes related to that along with the screenshot of the output in .png extension in order avoid confusion.
